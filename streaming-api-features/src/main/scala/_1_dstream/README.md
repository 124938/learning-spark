## DStream - Introduction

### What is DStream?

* Discretized Stream or DStream is the basic abstraction provided by Spark Streaming
* It represents a continuous stream of data, either the input data stream received from source, or the processed data stream generated by transforming the input stream
* Internally, a DStream is represented by a continuous series of RDDs, which is Sparkâ€™s abstraction of an immutable, distributed dataset

### DStream by example

* Any operation applied on a DStream translates to operations on the underlying RDDs
* In the `NetcatWordCount` example of converting a stream of lines to words, the `flatMap` operation is applied on each RDD in the lines DStream to generate the RDDs of the words DStream. This is shown in the following figure
